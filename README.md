# This mod is a fork from [Script Coded's chunk loaders](https://github.com/scriptcoded/scripts-chunk-loaders).

### Original description

Whether you're building a track between you and your friend's base to send resources or building an intricate automated rail network, minecarts don't load chunks and will most likely get stuck somewhere in the middle of your track. Script's Chunk Loaders adds new functionality to the dispenser to be able to mark a minecart as a chunk loader so it can keep on going on tracks infinitely far away from the player.

![Original Crafting](https://i.imgur.com/bG5sBpA.png)

Simply put the following pattern in a dispenser and when powered any minecart in front of it will become a chunk loader. Power it again to disable the chunk loader.

If the minecart has an inventory (such as a Minecart with Chest) and the first item has been renamed the chunk loader will be named "To <name of the item>".

### Note: This version of Script Coded's mod is **UNNOFICIAL**, not made by him. All credits for him, who had made the mod.

Also, I've changed the shape of the chunkloader, making to be instead of a glowstone block, Bedrock.
